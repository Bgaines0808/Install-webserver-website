create a vpc using the aws console.
Once the vpc is available build the server. Spin up the server and connect the ec2 to the vpc you just created. Now build the database
and connect it to the ec2 you just created.Also create the server creditials you will need to login into the server. You will need to
write down your server name, user login name, password and database name you will need it later in the project. Once you build the server
(keep the settings to the default)while still connected to your ec2 you will change the directory to /var/www and create a new subdirectory
named inc.
cd /var/www
mkdir inc
cd inc
Create a new file in the inc directory named dbinfo.inc, and then edit the file by calling nano.Add the following contents to the
dbinfo.inc file. Here, db_instance_endpoint
<?php

define('DB_SERVER', 'db_instance_endpoint');
define('DB_USERNAME', 'tutorial_user');
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'master password');
define('DB_DATABASE', 'sample');
?> 
Save your creditials for the server to the file. Save and close the dbinfo.inc file. Change the directory to /var/www/html.
Create a new file in the html directory named SamplePage.php, and then edit the file by calling nano (or the editor of your choice).
Add the following contents to the SamplePage.php file:
